# Gricean Pragmatics

Herbert Paul Grice - *Logic and Conversation* - University of California, Berkeley

Pragmatics - the study of how people use language in real conversations


## Conversational Implicature

**Implicature**: whatever is meant, but not literally said. Things that are
suggested, implied, or hinted at.

- implicatures that come about due to general features of conversation
- in general, conversations are cooperative efforts
- there is generally some goal or purpose to the conversation
- (understand & be understood / influence & be influenced / give & receive)

- Facts about:

    - the purpose of a conversation
    - the context of a conversation
    - our knowledge of the world

    Allow us to calculate the implicature.


## Cooperative Principle

Make a conversational contribution such as it is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged.

### The Four maxims

Not conventional rules of conversation, rather rules that govern rational cooperative activity in general.

1. Maxim of **Quantity**

  - make your contribution as informative as is required
  - do not make your contribution more informative than is required

2. Maxim of **Quality**

  - do not say what you believe to be false
  - do not say that for which you lack adequate

3. Maxim of **Relation**

  - be relevant
  - don't be irrelevant

4. Maxim of **Manner**

  - avoid obscurity of expression
  - avoid ambiguity
  - be brief
  - be orderly
