# Conditionals, Part 1

Example of a conditional sentence, a friend of mine says:

> If the bicycle needs repair, I will fix it.

Conditional sentences like the one above consist of two parts:

- **antecedent**: *"the bicycle needs repair"*
- **consequent**: *"I will fix it"*

One way of figuring out what the sentence told us is to get clear on what it has **not** told us. He hasn't told us the bicycle needs repair, and he also hasn't told us that he will fix the bicycle. Rather, what he said is that there is some connection between the bicycle needing repair and he fixing it. But what connection?

Here's a simple answer: by saying the sentence,gi he has told us that **it's not the case that**:

1. the bicycle needs repair

    **AND**

2. he won't fix it.

Equivalently, he said that **either**:

1. the bicycle doesn't need repair

    **OR**

2. he will fix it.
