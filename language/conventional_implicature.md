# Conventional and Conversational Implicature

**Meaning**: there's often a difference between what a speaker says and what a speaker means.

Take the sentence:

> I am tired.

Suppose someone asks you to go out on a date and you say *"I am tired"* as a response to them. The **linguist meaning** of what you had said is just that you were tired, that is, the meanings of the words *"I"*, *"am"* and *"tired"* are taken literally, combined into a sentence, and give you the straightforward meaning simply that you were tired. And that's all that you have said, taken literally.

However you've likely conveyed much more than this to the person who asked you out on a date. You most likely conveyed to the person that you don't want to go out on a date with them. So the *linguist meaning* here would be that you were tired while the **speaker meaning** would be what you really intended to convey to the person, namely, that you don't want to go out on the date. So you've turned down the invitation in a kind of an indirect way.

This is what ***Grice*** would have called a **conversational implicature**. So conversational implicatures are messages that speakers convey that are often above and beyond the literal meaning of the words that they speak. The trick ti it all is that speakers hope to get hearers to recognize their intention in speaking, even if this intention doesn't line up directly with the words that a speaker speaks. So in uttering a sentence, I hope to get my hearer to recognize what my purpose is in uttering it. 

If I say *"I am tired"* in response to an invitation, I hope that my heared will ask herself why I'm telling her that I'm tired. And as a result, I hope that she'll infer that I don't really want to go out on the date. So we now have two potential messages here: 

1. The literal meaning of the sentence *"I am tired"*.
2. The implied meaning that I don't want to go on the date.

The first of these meanings is what we call **conventional meaning** or **linguistic meaning**, that is, attached directly to the meanings of the words in question. The second meaning, which is the **implied meaning**, is **non-conventional**. By this I mean that the second meaning isn't attached to the meanings of the words *"I am tired"*. Furthermore, the sentence *"I am tired"* can have different implied meanings in other contexts.


## Three dimensions of meaning


#### Conventional truth conditional meaning

#### Conventional non truth conditional meaning

#### Non-conventional implied meaning
