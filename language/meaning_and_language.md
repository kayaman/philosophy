# Meaning and Language

What gives a word or utterance meaning?

- Descriptive Meaning Questions: what meaning the word actually has (as found in dictionaries).
- **Foundational Meaning Questions**: what determines the meaning of a word.

## Foundational Meaning Questions

Two ways to answer:

- Internalist: mental or psychological states determine meaning.
- Externalist: meaning is determined somewhere out - on natural features of the world or on the expertise of others in society.

### Speaker Intentions

Herbert Paul Grice argued that speaker intentions determine meaning. Intentions are purposes or goals we have in acting. Intentions of a specific sort can account for certain sounds and marks on a page or computer screen **being meaningful**. He developed the theory on which a sentence has a particular meaning given a speaker's or writer's intentions.
